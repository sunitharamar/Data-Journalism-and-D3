					<h3>Correlation Between Poverty and Lack of Health Care Coverage</h3>
					<p> We are exploring the associations between a specific demographic (poverty) and behavioral risk factor (lack of health care coverage). 
						The survey data was collected from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the Behavioral Risk
						Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) during the year of 2014. Each marker represents an individual state in
						the United States. Click on the markers to start exploring!</p>
					<p> The calculated correlation between Poverty and Lack of Health Care is -0.6183. </p>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Summary/Story telling of this Visualization</h3>
						<p> 1. Percentage of people in Poverty correlates very closely with the lack of Health Coverage in every State including Guam.</p>
						<p> 2. Guam, has the highest poverty rate with more than half the population is in poverty.</p>
						<p> 3. About half of 50 States have 20% or above of the population in Poverty </p>
						<p> 4. About 40 states have 10% or above of its population not covered with any healthcare.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Study of Healthcare related expenses in statues with 15% or higher population without health care benefits will 
						yield more info on the spending vs other states and also the age group of the population.</p>
